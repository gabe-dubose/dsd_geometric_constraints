## Geometric and genetic constraints on developmental system drift
This repository contains the code used to theoretically explore the geometric and genetic constraints on developmental system drift. 

### Scripts
```basic_fitness_landscape_visualization.py```: script used to visualize the emergent fitness ridge from a simple reaction diffusion model.

```compute_fitness_landscape_for_simulations.py```: script used to pre-compute a fitness landscape on which simulations can be run.

```neutral_manifold_dimensionality_analysis.py```: script used to implement a Monte Carlo estimation of fitness landscape geometry, which is also done as a function of developmental system dimensionality.

```visualize_dev_sys_complexity_analysis.py```: script used to visualize the results from <i>neutral_manifold_dimensionality_analysis.py</i>.

```recombination_constraints_simulations.py```: script used to run recombination analysis simulations.

```visualize_recombination_constraints.py```: script used to visualize recombination analysis simulations.
